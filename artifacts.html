				<h2> T shaped podcast </h2>
				<iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/313796572&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>
<p> This is my T shaped podcast, <i>Cereal</i>. We used a parody of the journalism mystery style podcast <i>Serial</i>. We incorporated humor as we explored the T component of the VT shaped student model.</p>

<p>We used an investigation and interveiw format to explore what it means to be a T shaped student. We created a parody of the genre by incorporating similar background music and sound effects, and had the host speak in a similar dramatic tone.</p>

<p>We approached the podcast as an investigation because we were learning about what a T shaped student was as we were writing the podcast. Ultimately we found that the T involves being well versed in your field of study, having a breadth of knowledge of other subjects, and incorporating technology no matter what your field of study &#40;which is where the enhanced T comes along&#41;. Thanks to the investigation &#40;and the help of Hugh Jackman&#41; we also come to the conclusion that even creative endeavors, like a film, require technological knowledge and creative writing and acting to come to life.</p>
				<h2> V shaped Video </h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2y9VfKEHw4o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p> Above is our video representing the V elements of the VT shaped student. We presented the information with humor by creating a paradoy of the television show, <i>The Office</i>.</p>
<p>In order to represent the V elements of the VT shaped student, we designed a student who was trying to balance both parts that make up the V. She wants to excell in class and also be an active participant in the community. Her boss and one of her professors have tension because they are concerned about her ability to balance both. Both thinks that the other component of the V should be scaled back. The student is adamant that she needs both her class &#40;the classroom learning part of the V&#41; and the internship &#40;the experiential learning side of the V&#41; to fully enrich her experience as a Virginia Tech student. She also participates in her community through involvement in organizations on campus.She represents a model of the V shaped individual who is using their time at school to become well rounded and prepared for life after college.</p>
