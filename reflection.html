							<h1>Reflection</h1>
							<h2>What Interested Me</h2>
							<p>The most interesting theme across this course for me was examining how the liberal arts are connected to the idea of the VT-shaped individual. The idea of the VT-shaped student supports breadth, experiential knowledge, and real world experience in connection with technology and Virginia Tech’s values. There is a lot of emphasis on innovation and technology, but the CLAHS perspective of the program gave me some interesting things to think about.</p>
							<p>After reading about the VT-shaped individual and how it incorporates different traits with values specific to the school, I was interested in learning more about how the concept applies to me as a student in CLAHS. I enjoyed reading a lot about the VT-shaped program from the perspective of the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences since people from the college have played a role in the shaping and implementation of the program.</p>
							<p>Virginia Tech is obviously a research emphasis institution with highly rated programs in the STEM fields, and those programs tend to get discussed ahead of most anything else that is going on at the school, which is understandable. Since the STEM side usually takes center stage, it can feel like the liberal arts programs are off in their own separate world. I like the emphasis on collaboration across disciplines from people who are implementing VT-shaped program in the liberal arts program. The selected readings and discussion from this unit focused on the ways CLAHS was incorporated in the VT-individual and the ideal way a student in liberal arts would be shaped by the initiative. Having programs that encourage collaboration is important because as President Sands said, &quot;What important problem can be solved only by engineers who are trained only in engineering, or by poets who have mastered only poetry&#63;&quot</p>
							<h2>HTML and Markdown</h2>
							<p>Before Writing and Digital Media, I hadn’t had much exposure to html so everything we covered was new to me. I hadn't even heard of Markdown before taking this course. One of the challenges of html was understanding how the different elements related to each other structurally and the importance of syntax. It is one thing to just copy and paste the tags, but actually understanding why you use one tag over another when it looks like they do the same thing was more confusing.</p>
							<p>I enjoyed the chance to work with basic coding and learning how to use Github for this course. It's a practical skill to have, but it also just looks really cool when you have different documents open. Even if I was just creating a basic page that had headings, paragraphs and not much else, it still looked like something more involved and interesting to my friends who don’t have much experience in this area.</p>

							<h2>Digital Writing</h2>
							<p>After completing Unit One my definition of digital writing was as follows: digital writing encompasses all of the written content that will be presented to your audience and the platform the writing appears on. This course has emphasized the importance of digital writing for me as well as the range that digital writers can possess. Digital writing can also involve the writing that goes in to making podcasts and videos, like <a href="artifacts.html">the ones we've created</a> in this course. We had to write and edit scripts using Markdown and Fountain before we could bring the productions to life. Digital writers write for the web, video, and other mediums. Adapting to various technologies in order to do so is important.</p>
						</p>Realistically, most writers usually can’t be just writers anymore. They don’t necessarily have to be experts about the tech side of things, but technology is an inevitable fact of life so having some knowledge about what is going on is important. Digital writing relates to the VT-shaped individual because it can help give the students the technological edge that the school emphasizes. Having some technological literacy will also serve to make a Virginia Tech graduate more marketable in the future, which is consistent with advice I’ve received during my time as a student. </p>

							<p>In my PR classes and in PRSSA there is a lot of emphasis on having a well-rounded skill set. A student who wants to be a PR practitioner should be comfortable with traditional communication, but also feel comfortable using more digital aspects. Many people who work in communication also have to be able to do a lot of different things because sometimes one person can be responsible for maintaining social media platforms, website content, or creating press kits.</p>
