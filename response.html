    <h1>Reading Response 2</h1>
    <h2>Major Ideas and Themes</h2>
    <p>The selected readings from this module emphasize the combination of thinking, innovation, technology across various disciplines. Lessig argues that being able to take ideas and alter and build upon them is big part of being in a free culture. </p>
    <p>Creators like Walt Disney didn't always take completly new or original ideas but they did think of ways to innovate what was already out there.They looked to the world around them and saw what was already out there and infused their own ideas in order to put something new back out into the world.The idea of the VT-shaped individual relates to these concepts because they are supposed to have expertise their field of study as well as outside experiences to help them innovate in the real world.</p>
    <p>The VT-shaped student would ideally be able to &quot;rip, mix, and burn&quot; ,ideas in the real world in order to solve problems. Virginia Tech's VT shaped individual combines traditional ideas of the T with the school's motto and land-grant mission.</p>
    <p>The concept of the VT-shaped student focuses on expanding the idea of the T student that already existed. The T-shaped student's knowledge and experiences is deep in their discipline and covers a wide area. The V in the VT-shaped student combines the notion of a student well versed in their discipline with the school's motto, Ut Prosim, as well as opportunities for interdisciplinary learning nad innovation in order to give them an edge in the future. The idea of a VT-shaped student is focused on students not only being able to excel in their area of study, but also expose them to things that are not directly related to their bookwork. Ideally, after being shaped by this VT-model curriculum a student will have real life experiences and an exposure to technology &lpar;especially if that isn't technically part of their major.&rpar;</p>
    <h2>Interesting Quotations and Arguments</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>From the January VT News article <i>New program to highlight enrichment opportunities for students</i>: &quot;To create these kinds of learners, it may be useful to remember that, alongside invention, we need to find both inspiration and imagination.&quot;</li>
      <li>From Lessig: &quot;&quot;Walt Disney creativity&quot;-a form of expression and genius that builds upon the culture around us and makes it something different.&quot; </li>
      <li>From the Roanoake Times article:&quot;He's trying to move the campus toward a future in which researchers will work on big problems together in ways that emphasize collaboration over smaller, separate innovations&quot; </li>
      <li>A President Sands quote from <i>The CLAHS VT-shaped learner</i>: &quot;What important problem can be solved only by engineeres who are trained only in engineering, or by poets who have mastered only poetry?&quot; </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>How should schools trying to impelent these &quot;innovation districts&quot; and other advancements include professors in the process?</li>
      <li>What does Lessig mean when he says culture is getting less free?</li>
      <li>How realistic is the idea of the VT-shaped student and how is it  different from degrees requiring CLEs?</li>
    </ul>
