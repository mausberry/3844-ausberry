							<h2>About me </h2>
							<p>My name is Happy Hokie and I am a Public Relations major at Virginia Tech. I am also pursuing a minor in political science.I began taking courses in the PTW program because I want to pursue the minor. My PR classes focus on a lot of application and writing, but we don't really have as much of the digital side past a few introductory classes, which is why I like being in a class like Writing and Digital Media.</p>
						  <p>I don’t have much experience in digital writing outside of this course; so many of the basics of html and other sections of the course are totally new to me. I signed up for Writing and Digital Media because I wanted to get some exposure to more technical aspects of writing that I haven’t really had in my communication or political science courses yet. Some of the skills we practice in this course will be helpful to me as I develop my portfolio of work from my other classes.</p>
							<h2>My Interests at Virginia Tech</h2>
<p>At Virginia Tech I am active in the Public Relations Student Society of America &#40;PRSSA&#41; and Virginia Tech Television &#40;VTTV&#41;. Both groups emphasize the importance of experience outside the classroom, including getting involved in committees within the group and having internships related to your field.  This advice fits with the philosophy of the VT-shaped individual because part of the &quot;V&quot; is learning by doing. PRSSA and VTTV also emphasize the importance of having a range of skills, including digital ones. Digital writing is a big part of communication, especially because so much of what people do is online, so many employers are looking for people who have a skillset that accommodates the need for digital communication.</p>
<h2> My Goals </h2>
<p>I am still figuring out what I want to do in the future, and I've been able to explore some of my interests through extracurriculars, internships, and volunteer opportunites. One of my goals is to continue using the skills I've learned in this course throughout the rest of college and in the future.</p>
